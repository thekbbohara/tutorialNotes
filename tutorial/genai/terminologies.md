- Label: The specific category assigned to the output of a single data point.

- Labeled data: Data that is paired with specific output labels or annotations.
                Each input has a corresponding known output that the model should learn to predict.

- Unlabeled data: Raw input without any guidance on what the output should be.

- Machine Learning(ML): Subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical model that enables computer to perform tasks without explicit programming.
                        Instead of following predefined rules, ML systems learns from data to learn and improve their performance over time.

- Supervised: A type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data. 

- Unsupervised: A type of ML where the model is trained on unlabeled data. 

- semi-supervised: Mix of both labeled and unlabeled data.
                  This method leverages a small amount of labeled data along with larger amount of unlabeled data to improve learning efficiency and accuracy.

- Model: a model is a mathematical representation of a process. It learns patterns from data to make predictions or generate new content.
  Models can be supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised

- Class==Category: It represent one of the possible outputs that a model can predict.
